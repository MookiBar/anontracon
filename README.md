# Requirements

  * Python

# Sample Execution & Output

The agent needs to run in the background as root.
The client can run in the background as the currend desktop-session user.

The easiest way to start these is to first start the agent as root using the included script...

```
sudo bash ./usr/bin/anontracon_agent
```
...and then start the client...
```
bash ./usr/bin/anontracon_client
```
